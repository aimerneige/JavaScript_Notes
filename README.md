# Personal Notes When Learning JavaScript

## About

Personal notes when learning JavaScript.

I am reading the book *Professional JavaScript for Web Developers Second Edition* in Chinese.

Although I am from China, all of the notes will be written in English, because I want to learn English in this way. So please forgive me if there are any mistakes in English.

## Requirement

This note is more suitable for those **who have programming experience**. You must learn at least one programming language like `C`, `C++`, `Java` or `python`. If you have never learned any kind of programming language, you should choose one of the programming languages for beginners to learn before reading my notes. I recommend you learn `C` or `C++`.

## Q&A

- Will this have Chinese support?

> I think no. I am using Linux so I may support Chinese when I have a nice software to input Chinese on Linux. But I think it's hard or even impossible.

Sometimes I will write some useful article on my blog <https://aimerneige.com>.\
